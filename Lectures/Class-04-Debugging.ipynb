    "- If you are building the program incrementally, you should have a good idea about where the error is. \n",
    "    - It will be in the last line you added\n",
    "- If you are copying code from a book, or the internet, start by comparing your code to the book's or website's code very carefully.\n",
    "    - Check every character. \n",
    "    - Remember that the book or website might be wrong, or using an incompatible software version\n",
    "        - If you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might not be your fault\n",
